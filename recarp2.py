list is a collection of items in a particular order.
it can contain strings, ints or a mix of both in [] separated by commas.

accessing individual items in a list.
the first item in a list is at index zero. while the last item is accessed at index -1.

"""
working with lists. looping through entire lists.
the concept of looping is important because itâ€™s one of the most common 
ways a computer automates repetitive tasks

"""
making numerical lists. using the range parameter
"""
